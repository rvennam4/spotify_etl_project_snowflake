# **Spotify End-to-End Data Pipeline: AWS & Snowflake Integration** 🎵☁️❄️  

## **Objective**  
This project demonstrates how to **extract, transform, and analyze** Spotify music data using **Python, AWS, and Snowflake**. The goal is to build an automated data pipeline that fetches Spotify’s music data, processes it, and loads it into Snowflake for further analysis.

---

## **🔹 Tech Stack & Approach**  

🐍 **Python (Spotipy Library):** Used to interact with **Spotify’s API**, fetch music data, and structure it for further processing.  

☁️ **Amazon Web Services (AWS):**  
- **AWS Lambda:** Automates **data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL)**.  
- **Amazon S3:** Acts as **intermediate storage** for both raw and processed data.  

🌨️ **Snowflake (Data Warehouse):**  
- **Snowflake tables:** Serve as the central **analytics repository**.  
- **Snowpipe:** Enables **automated real-time ingestion** of new data.  

📊 **Power BI for Visualization (Optional):**  
- Create **interactive dashboards** for music trends & insights.

## **🔹 Architecture & Workflow**  

1️⃣ **Data Extraction:**  
- Python (with Spotipy) pulls **music data** directly from the **Spotify API**.  
- Extracted JSON data is stored in **AWS S3 (raw storage)**.  

2️⃣ **Automated Data Transformation:**  
- **AWS Lambda functions** process raw JSON into structured datasets (Songs, Albums, Artists).  

3️⃣ **Data Processing & Loading:**  
- Processed data is stored in **AWS S3 (transformed storage)**.  
- **Snowpipe automatically ingests data** into **Snowflake**, ensuring real-time availability.  

4️⃣ **Analytics & Visualization:**  
- Data in Snowflake is now ready for querying and insights.  
- (Optional) Power BI can be used for **interactive dashboards & reporting**.

## **🚀 Impact & Learnings**  
✅ Built a **scalable & automated ETL pipeline** from scratch.  
✅ Enhanced skills in **AWS services (Lambda, S3), Snowflake, and Python**.  
✅ Streamlined **real-time data ingestion** with Snowpipe.  
✅ Enabled future enhancements like **real-time streaming & advanced analytics**.  


## **💡 Future Enhancements**  
🔹 Add **real-time streaming** with Kafka or AWS Kinesis.  
🔹 Extend to include **user listening history** analytics.  
🔹 Build **AI-driven recommendations** based on Spotify data.
